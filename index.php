											India from the wooded valley of Irrawady, on the one hand, and the hilly

											splendour are radiant in myth and mystery. These, the youngest and tallest mountain

What is India and what is her identity? Is she as elusive 
to find as the insides of a seed? A mere country cannot assume 
the bewitching charms that hang on her slender wrists. So, how to
encounter the real India?The name Himavat in the above passage
refers not only to the snow-capped ranges of the
Himalayas but also to their less elevated offshoots - the 
Patkai, Lushai and Chittagong Hills in the east, and the Sulaiman
and Kirthar ranges in the west. These go down to the Sea and separate
India from the wooded valley of Irrawady, on the one hand, and the hilly

Sit by the ruins, and see the inscriptions carved on the walls of caves, and listen.
 Listen to the seers and the folklorists, to the waters of the perennial rivers and 
 the echoes from the immortal gigantic mountains. Look at the personifications of prayer
 carved out of marble or stone, and lie under a banyan tree, and listen - Listen to India.
India Map India is the name given to the vast peninsula which the continent of Asia throws
 out to the south of the magnificent mountain ranges that stretch in a sword like curve across
 the southern border of Tibet. Shaped like an irregular quadrilateral, this large expanse of territory
 we call India, deserves the name of a subcontinent. Ancient Geographers referred to India as being 
 "constituted with a four-fold conformation" (chatuh samasthana samsthitam), "on its South and West
 and East is the Great Ocean, the Himavat range stretches along its north like the string of a bow". </p>
